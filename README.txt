Step 1: Either pull files from GitHub via (in Terminal) wget https://github.com/kiefersmith/WNC-Newsletter or copy them to a directory of your choosing.

Step 2: Double-click on the file named 'wnc_setup.command'.  If successful, the script will download and install all necessary dependencies for the program.  You will only have to run this once.

Step 3: Double-click on the file named 'wnc_run.command'.  This will run the R program and export the WNC Newsletter graphs.

Step 4: Create a new folder and move the appropriate graphs to the new folder (if you wish to save them).  Each time you run 'wnc_run.command' the graphs will be overwritten.
